# clip
Clip is a wrapper around xclip, because I am lazy and there is way too many characters to type to quite simply copy some text to the clipboard.

## Install

Trust me?

```
curl -sL https:git.io/clipinstall | bash
```

But I recommend you clone the repo and read it first, itâ€™s pretty short

then at your leisure

`cp clip /usr/local/bin`

or somewhere in your path
